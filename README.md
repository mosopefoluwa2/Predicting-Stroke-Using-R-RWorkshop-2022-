# Predicting Stroke Using R: RWorkshop 2022

#### This is the final project for the R Programming for Statistical Analysis Workshop.
#### During this workshop, exoloratory data analysis and data visualisation, especially using tidyverse and ggplot, were concepts that of R programming that stood out for me during this workshop. I am particularly interested in the analysis of data for prediction. This project involves analysis of a health dataset obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset). The objectives of this project are:
###### 1. understanding data by carry out exploratory data analysis - univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis
###### 2. pre-processing the data - cleaning the data by removing duplicates and replacing missing values
###### 3. re-do exploratory data analysis on the now cleaned dataset
###### 4. predict the occurence of stroke using machine learning.
